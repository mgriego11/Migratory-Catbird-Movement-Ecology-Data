Dumetella carolinensis data: triglyceride, metabolic rate, quantitative body composition

Description 

Data was collected on free-living migratory Catbirds on St. George Island, FL USA. Blood samples, quantitative body composition measurements, and metabolic rates were collected in the field prior to birds being released. Feather isotope data was later analyzed in a laboratory setting.
